# Testing

To test SBT plugin scenarios, run the `scripted` task from sbt shell.

## Format

Each directory under sbt-checkstyle-java indicates an individual SBT test.  The commands in the `test` file will be executed.  See [SBT documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html) for more details.
